# ExceptionHandling Smart Contract

This Solidity smart contract provides examples of exception handling using `require`, `assert`, and `revert` statements. It includes three functions:

1. **requireExample:** Demonstrates the use of the `require` statement. It checks if `x` is greater than `y` and reverts with an error message if the condition is not met.

2. **assertExample:** Demonstrates the use of the `assert` statement. It checks if `a` is less than `b` and triggers an unrecoverable error if the condition is not met.

3. **revertExample:** Demonstrates the use of the `revert` statement. It performs some logic, checks if `amount` exceeds 100, and triggers a revert with an error message if the condition is not met.

## Usage

Feel free to deploy this smart contract on your preferred Ethereum development environment or testnet. Interact with the contract using your favorite Ethereum wallet or development tool.
